# What is it?
This project is a small personal blog for myself. You can see it at [zhchoward.pythonanywhere.com](http://zhchoward.pythonanywhere.com/)
#Purpose
Practising programming with Flask and MongoDB. However, I have to change MongoDB into SQLite, because pythonanywhere only provides SQLite and MySQL as database for free account.
#Future
Now, the website is very simple. But I am going to add more functions to it. And I plan to learn javascript in the future, I believe this website will become better and better.
